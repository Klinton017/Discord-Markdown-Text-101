# **DISCORD MARKDOWN TEXT 101**
Want to spice up your Discord messages with some flavour and personality, well then you have found the right place. 
Discord uses something called Markdown text, a simple yet powerful text formatting system, that can help make your sentences pop.
All you have to do is just plop a few characters in front of a text, and viola a unique sentence is created

This guide contains the following:



# **TEXT FORMATTING**


*Italics* → \*Italic\* **OR** \_Italics\_

__*Underline italics*__ → \_\_\*Underline italics\*_\_


**Bold** → \*\*Bold\*\*

__**Underline Bold**__ → \_\_\*\*Underline Bold\*\*_\_


***Bold italics*** → \*\*\*Bold and Italic\*\*\*

__***underline bold italics***__ → \_\_\*\*\*underline bold italics\*\*\*_\_


__Underline__ → \_\_Underline\_\_


~~Strikethrough~~ → \~\~Strikethrough\~\~

# **ORGANISATIONAL TEXT FORMATTING**


#### **HEADERS**

To create a header you just need to include a specific number of the hash/pound sign character (#). Use (#) for a big header, (##) for a smaller header, or (###) for an even smaller header as the first character(s) in a new line to make a header. Here is an example of what each header type looks like.

\# Big Header

\## Smaller Header

\### Even Smaller Header
